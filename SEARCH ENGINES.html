<div><b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b></div>
<div>There are two places where SEO is implemented. First in websites and second in keyword advertising.  Here I will a address the main points regarding SEO and Websites.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Preparation</b></div>
<div>There is little reason to spend time and money optimizing a website</div>
<div>for search engines if that web site is not presentable. Visitors will not stay if your</div>
<div>website is not:</div>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetically appealing</li>
<li>Focused</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Mobile friendly</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All of these points reduce credibility and increase the likelihood of a visitor moving on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Search-ability</b></div>
<div>Currently there are two key search engines in North America: Google and Bing.</div>
<div>In order for these search engines to be aware of you site it must be <i>indexed.</i> A web site</div>
<div>cannot be indexed if it contains a <b><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">robots.txt</span></b> file which contains directives to ignore</div>
<div>a site. For details see...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Keywords</b></div>
<div>Keywords are the words and terms typed into a search engine. A web site should be designed</div>
<div>to match keyword searches by including words and terms that a search engine can easily use.</div>
<div>The goal of a search engine is to abstract content carefully, so that it can present accurate and</div>
<div>useful results.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div><b>What search engines use</b></div>
<div>Search engines can be told about keywords and given descriptions-but they do their own thinking now.  The "keywords" "meta tag and the "description" meta tag are still used, but they are largely de-emphasised in favor of website content and website name.   In a sense, search engines define your keywords for you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Credibility is a key issue in how search engines rank results. The most important factor in credibility is backlinks. In other words</div>
<div>the number of other websites that point to your website. No question search engines filter out websites containing foul words too. </div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div><b>How to structure content for SEO</b></div>
<div>Search engines parse and analyze content.  This means the domain name should be a clue to site content. </div>
<div>In fact, interior URLs should also be used to impart information related to search terms.  Next comes the site title which should be  highly supportive of (and consistent with) site content. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Search engines factor site structure and hierarchy to further quantify content. For this reason, placing an important term in an <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">h1</span> tag is better than placing it in a div tag with a class to emphasize it.  For the same reason, text with a larger font or placed nearer the top of a site is given more weight in evaluating the purpose of a site.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Conversely, images and embedded content such as video, do not support a site theme because they are not read or interpreted by search engines.   At best, a search engine can using image and video file names to support a sites theme.</div>
