<div><b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b></div>
<div>There are two places where SEO is implemented. First in websites and second in keyword advertising.  Here I will a discuss the main points regarding SEO and Websites.</div>
<div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Preparation</b></div>
</div>
<div>There is little reason to spend time and money optimizing a website</div>
<div>for search engines if that web site is not ready. Visitors will not stay if your</div>
<div>
<div>website is not:</div>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetically appealing</li>
<li>Focused</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Mobile friendly</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All of these points reduce credibility, increase frustration and increase the likelihood of a visitor moving on.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Search-ability</b></div>
<div>Currently there are two key search engines in North America: Google and Bing.</div>
<div>In order for these search engines to be aware of you site it must be <i>indexed.</i> A web site</div>
</div>
<div>cannot be indexed if it contains a <b><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">robots.txt</span></b> file which contains directives to ignore</div>
<div>a site. For details see <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en">https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en</a></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Keywords</b></div>
<div>Keywords are the words and terms typed into a search engine. A web site should be designed</div>
</div>
<div>to match keyword searches by including words and terms that a search engine can translate into a direct match.</div>
<div>The goal of a search engine is to abstract web content into terms that accurately summarize that nature of you website, so that it can present authentic and useful results.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div><b>What search engines use</b></div>
<div>Search engines can be told about keywords and given descriptions-but they do their own thinking now.  The "keywords" "meta tag and the "description" meta tag are still used, but they are largely de-emphasised in favor of actual website content and website name.   In a sense, search engines define your keywords for you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Credibility is a key issue in how search engines rank results. The most important factor in credibility is backlinks. In other words</div>
<div>the number of other websites that point to your website.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Search ranking will be negatively impacted by:</div>
<ul>
<li>Not using SSL/TSL</li>
<li>Adult content</li>
<li>A lack of focus</li>
<li>Too many ads</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div><b>How to structure content for SEO</b></div>
<div>Search engines parse and analyze content.  This means the domain name should be a clue to site content. </div>
<div>In fact, interior URLs should also be used to impart information related to search terms.  Next comes the site title which should be  highly supportive of (and consistent with) site content. Title-casing is recommended for readability.  In order to make it physically visible,  the title length should be  short as possible but still informative.  I would say no more that 30 characters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Search engines factor site structure and hierarchy to further quantify content. For this reason, placing an important term in an <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">h1</span> tag is better than placing it in a div tag with a class to emphasize it.  For the same reason, text with a larger font or placed nearer the top of a site is given more weight in evaluating the purpose of a site.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Conversely, images and embedded content such as video, do not support a sites theme because they are not read or interpreted by search engines.   At best, a search engine can using image and video file names to support a sites theme.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Further optimization</b></div>
<div>There are to additional things that will increase the attractiveness of a web site. First, include a sitemap that can be understood by search engines.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Second,  increase site comprehension by search engines using standardized metadata.  There are several vocabularies available to do this.  I discovered <b><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">schema.org</span></b> first, and for this reason have a bias towards it.  Schema.org is a community effort to define a common semantic vocabulary used primarily for annotating websites.  Annotations, are implemented as small key=value attribute pairs which impart relationships and content type in html using a non-invasive form. For example,</div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&lt;section  itemtype='http://schema.org/PostalAddress'&gt;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">Street: &lt;span itemprop="streetAddress"&gt;123 Somelane&lt;/span&gt;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">City: &lt;span itemprop="city"&gt;Windy Butte&lt;/span&gt;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">State: &lt;span itemprop="state"&gt;Windy Butte&lt;/span&gt;</span></div>
<div> </div>
